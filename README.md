# Anomaly-Detection-ECG
This project leverages deep learning (autoencoders) for automated ECG anomaly detection. Trained on normal ECG data, the model identifies deviations from typical heart patterns, improving accuracy in distinguishing normal and abnormal signals. This project aims to develop automated ECG monitoring systems for better patient outcomes.
